# Good code

## Introduction

There is not a single answer for the question _What is good code?_. There are many different opinions on what good code is. I will try to explain what I think good code is and how to achieve it in the context of web applications development.

Even if we narrow the scope, there are still many different opinions. Programming is not a science nor a religion. It is maybe a craft about meaning and communication. We can hardly measure the quality of the code with precision. The same goes for books: we can not really tell if the book is crap or excellent, it is very much a matter of taste, education and opinion rather than a fact. 

The industry has not been really trying to answer this question properly. Short term speed is seen as a productivity factor, it is not. Not a long time ago I was asked to not make unit tests as they were slowing down the development. Which is nuts, obviously. Velocity is usually told to be a metric for a _good_ team to improve, ignoring the fact that bad code usually lead the team to perform very poorly. I think velocity tends to create bad behaviors among developers but it might be useful at business level. The industry has come out with a bunch of tools to manage communication and time, but very little to ensure the quality of the code maybe because it is just very hard. So we have to deal with imperfection all the time, there is no way out.

## What is quality

When I listen what people think about quality it is clear that the level of abstraction does not meet the constant need for practical thinking in the development arena:

- "Quality is something that happens when the developers or the user experiences a software object. In software development, what is the event?: The next feature, the next release, the user, the system. Somehow if the quality of the event is good by some metrics, then the quality of the event is good."

- "Quality is something that is valuable to someone at some point in time".
  
Ideally the goal (the thing that is valuable so we measure it) should be shared across the organization. Otherwise we can find quality expectations that are contrarian between teams. Quality in software can be influenced not only by the code itself but maybe also by the infrastructure, the way to test, the way to operate as a company. The goals are shared but the expectations regarding quality are different depending on the role, each team has to bring their own metrics about the expectations towards the achievement of the company goals.

It is very difficult to find metrics that shows improvements in quality given that it depends heavily on context and context is a multi variable reality. We need to be concise in what is that we want and yet choose metrics that talk about the whole system, for instance:

- Lead time.
- Velocity.
- Number of bugs.
- How quickly can we test the whole system.
- Test coverage.

I tend as a developer to focus on the code itself whatever the outcome is. Here are some expectations about the code that I think are important to improve the metrics above:

## Testable, readable, changeable

I would argue that good code must be easily testable, readable and changeable:

- A test is the only proof that the code works. Code without tests is untrustworthy.
- A unit test only asserts business rules.
- A good unit test is possible if the code is very well decoupled. So it is key to have an architecture that allows to isolate the business code, like hexagonal architecture (Ports and adapters). 
- Our business code must be framework-agnostic, database-agnostic, etc...
- Code that has to be modified by many people over time must be highly readable vertically and horizontally.
    - The names must be meaningful, consistent, precise and the semantics are shared by the team and across the codebase.
    - Expressive arborescence of the project: if I deploy all the items of the tree I have to be able to know what the application does without opening a single file.
    - Technical details are hidden behind abstractions. I do not care if it is MongoDb or Postgres behind the repository, I just want to operate an action on a domain entity.
- Code must be easily changeable. The _S.O.L.I.D._ principles are a good way to achieve this.
- Functions or methods are well defined, have single responsibility, and whenever possible they are idempotent (which are super easy to test), isolate side effects (like sending and email or modifying the state of the database).
- Avoid abstractions unless you are sure that you need them.
- Pay more attention to data, sometime is just simpler to carry data around from inputs to outputs without adding behavior to it.
- Decrease coupling, increase cohesion.
- Avoid inheritance, prefer composition.

## How

### Hexagonal architecture AKA Ports and adapters.

Mostly achieved by doing dependency inversion between this two:
    - the domain code (the thing that makes unique the application) 
    - the infrastructure (the frameworks, the libraries and the databases)

Meaning that the domain code does not depend on the infrastructure, but the infrastructure depends on the domain code. I show an example below.

But generally speaking, as said by Robert C. Martin: "The Dependency Rule says that source code dependencies can only point inwards. Nothing in an inner circle can know anything at all about something in an outer circle. In particular, the name of something declared in an outer circle must not be mentioned by the code in the an inner circle. That includes, functions, classes. variables, or any other named software entity."

So it is clever to pay attention to the imports list at the very beginning of the file. If you see a dependency to a framework or a database and this is domain related code, you are doing it wrong.

### SOLID principles (SRP, OCP, LSP, IS, DI)

Again Robert C. Martin came out with this list of principles that are very useful to improve quality.

#### SRP Single responsibility principle

**There is one reason to change a piece of code**. A piece of code can be represented by a function, a class, a module...

Or another way to see that: the piece of code should only do one thing. This is not about the number of lines of code, it is about the responsibility of the code taken in a more abstract level.

#### OCP Open to extension, close to modification

A class can modify its behavior at runtime if we inject interfaces, not implementations.

Or put in other words: We can change the behavior according to the implementation that is chosen in runtime. This way we can extend or modify the behavior of the code without modifying it directly, we just create a new implementation. This is very useful for testing, for example. We can inject a mock/spy implementation of a piece of code (like a repository) to test the business code. If you have to learn a useful design pattern, learn strategy pattern.

#### LSP Liskov substitution principle.

This one I find it less useful because I just **avoid inheritance as much as possible**. 

But the idea is that an instance of a child class should be replaceable by its parent class without breaking the code. The internal behavior may change obviously but the code must work. This is known as type-subtype correctness.

#### IS Interface segregation

This one is super useful. A class should not be forced to implement methods that are not needed.

In my experience you can achieve that by having in mind that you should **design your interfaces for the client** and not for the implementation. TDD (Test driven development) can help a lot here because you will only write the code that is needed.

#### DI Dependency inversion

Domain code does not depend on external modules or libraries. Our domain defines the way external modules must behave if the want to talk to us. This is how we inverse the dependency. Let's see an example using an object called `Folder`, imagine it is important in our domain.

Here we define _the interface_ (the port in terms of Hexagonal architecture) that the infrastructure layer must implement (the implementation is the adapter) if they have to communicate:

```typescript
import { Folder } from './Folder';

export interface FolderRepository {
    save(folder: Folder): Promise<void>;
}
```

Then the infrastructure layer will implement this interface like this one for using TypeOrm:

```typescript
// ... imports
import { EntitySchema } from 'typeorm';

export class TypeOrmFolderRepository extends TypeOrmRepository<Folder> implements FolderRepository {
    public async save(folder: Folder): Promise<void> {
        return this.persist(folder);
    }

    protected entitySchema(): EntitySchema<Folder> {
        return FolderEntity;
    }
}
```

And then we can inject this implementation in our domain. This is the use case that creates a folder (the client for which we have designed the interface):

```typescript
export class FolderCreator {
    constructor(private readonly repository: FolderRepository, private readonly eventBus: EventBus) {}

    async run(request: FolderCreatorRequest): Promise<void> {
        const folder = Folder.create(new FolderId(request.id), new FolderName(request.name));
        await this.repository.save(folder);
        await this.eventBus.publish(folder.pullDomainEvents());
    }
}
```

As you see in this example, the `FolderRepository` is injected via the constructor, it is an interface so we can use whatever implementation we want in runtime without being coupled to concrete implementations.

This use case _FolderCreator_ is super easy to test because has no dependencies on external modules.

### Code review

Check out this post I wrote on code reviews: [Code review](2019-03-25-code-review.md)

### Static analysis tools / code standards

We need to automate anything that we can automate on this topic, at least the linting and the formatting of the code using whatever code style by default as long as it is consistent and becomes a team convention.

A .editorConfig can help as well to keep rules consistent across the team.

Static analysis tools like SonarQube can help giving insights about the quality of the code.

### Security

I am not an expert on the topic but there are a few things to consider for starters. Good code have to consider security as well:

- Pay attention to [OWASP 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/).
- Work with modern technologies and well supported libraries and frameworks.
- Update your dependencies regularly. Take the time to update to major versions, do not let your code die.
- Automate security updates.
- Be aware of the news of our ecosystem.
- Let external experts audit your applications.
- Do not trust user input. Sanitize sql code.
- Robust and well-tested authentication and authorization system.
- Know CORS.
- Strong ACL.
- Know the basics of networking.

### Performance

Generally speaking I do not consider that the gain of milliseconds is worth the effort most of the time regarding quality. So I would go with the more expressive, readable and testable code. The famous quote _"Make it work, make it right, make it fast"_ by Kent Beck is a good way to see it.

Some complexity analysis with O notation can lead to discover interesting things and make your code much faster. But I would not consider for example to reduce indirections in my code (like putting everything in one file or not creating interfaces etc...). Readability and testability are much more important at the end of the day, at least until AI could really write complex applications for us.

### Data

Some knowledge of data structures will not hurt. 

I tend to find the mix of data and behavior usually done in OOP less and less useful and prone to errors.

Classes are useful to define invariants, but we may not need them to represent data at all. I think that mixin data and behavior should not be the default.

### Domain driven design

A body of knowledge that started with the book of Eric Evans, focus on modeling systems using the language of the domain (the ubiquitous language). The design is driven by the domain and not by the technical details. It is a very interesting approach to design software but it does not guarantee good code of course.

If the domain is complex, it is a good idea to use this approach. If the domain is simple, it is probably an overkill. Sometimes it might be useful to think in DDD terms at business level without implementing every pattern in our code base. We do not want premature optimization.

DDD has to aspects:

- The strategy: A method for problem exploration.

- The tactic: How to design the code itself:
    - Data:
        - Value objects.
        - Entities.
        - Aggregates.
        - Repositories.
        - Factories.
    - Behavior:
        - Application services.
        - Domain services.
        - Infrastructure services.

We need to calibrate the both of them depending on the context of our application to avoid overuse. The tactical part is quite prescriptive so take it with a grain of salt.

Hexagonal architecture fits very well with DDD because of this protection of the domain code from the infrastructure.

Event storming is a very useful tool to explore the domain and create the ubiquitous language. It is a workshop that involves all the stakeholders of the project. It is a very good way to start a project. But it should not automatically translates into code design. You still need to think about the code design but you already have a good idea of the domain and the semantics.

I think most of the time DDD is overkill for the majority of CRUDY applications. 

Also I think it is a very OOP oriented approach with this mix of data and behavior that I do not find very useful sometimes. It is also very entity/aggregate centric creating kind of an untouchable ivory tower representing the domain. I would rather start with the verbs (the actions the external world want to perform on the system).

## Books

A few books that I think are very useful to understand what good code is:

- [Clean code](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882)
- [Clean architecture](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Architecture-Craftsmans-Software-Structure/dp/0134494164)
- [Domain driven design](https://www.amazon.com/Domain-Driven-Design-Tackling-Complexity-Software/dp/0321125215)
- [Grokking Simplicity](https://www.manning.com/books/grokking-simplicity)

The last one is less known but I think that if you are an OOP developer you also need to be familiar with functional programming, many concepts are very useful to write better code in whatever paradigm. This is a gentle intro with javascript.
