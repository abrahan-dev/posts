# Simplicity in code

It is always difficult to define a concept that is generally used in a subjective way, meaning different things.

When we say something is simple, it could have positive or negative connotations depending on the context and the intention.

Regarding programming, simplicity could be the result of breaking down complex needs into simple things so that we can compose without too much hustle.

In programming, saying that "something is simple" often means that it is easy to understand and use.

## The love and death of object oriented programming

I believe that OOP is a paradigm that does not help in the crusade to divide and conquer complexity, instead it feeds up the agglomeration of ideas and concepts into low quality abstractions.

Because we have built OOP, we need design patterns. Maybe OOP makes simple things complex, while FP (functional programming) makes complex things simple. Also FP makes micro-things harder and macro things easier while OOP makes micro-things easier and macro things harder. If we use simpler blocks that relate more naturally, then we do not need design patterns.

## A good programmer

A good programmer can have many qualities, but an indispensable one is being able to make good abstractions. After many years developing OOP I think that OOP does not help _per se_. 

Another quality is being able to translate complex business ideas into simple code.

## A few rules

Simplicity is likely to be achieved with a combination of ideas from various paradigms, including OOP and FP, where data and functions are first-class passengers, while classes are used only to guarantee [invariants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invariant_(mathematics)#Invariants_in_computer_science).

- Separate data from code
- Use immutable data whenever possible. It may be prohibitive in data science, but most applications can take advantage of it.
- Use generic data structures separate from the schema. In other words, if a hash map is all what you need, use it.
- Use data as a first class citizen
- Use json in native form without transformations / proxies / objects wrapping around...
- Say things in a more declarative way
- Do not share more than youâ€™d like to

## Where is my function?

I am not an expert FP programmer, just an _aficionado_, but given the amount of work that OOP code need and the cost per bug, I'd say that classes are not efficient tools.

I think with FP the cost per bug can be reduced at a price: the granularity of the system can be overwhelming. 

How do we write our functions and organise them is key.

## Conclusion

This is about changing our mental models as programmers to accomodate simplicity. Think first data and functions, then classes for invariants.

As stated in the great book "The case against reality" by Donald Hoffman, evolution optimises for fitness, not for truth. Maybe programmers also optimise for something that is just an interface, not for discovering the truth underneath the abstraction. We depend heavily on space (computational types repetition) and time (for loops). 

I think true simplicity will come whenever we get rid of those. There is A LOT of repetition in every code base.  We are always using the same phrases (computational types) to achieve the same things (homogeneous transformations of inputs into outputs, performing side-effects...). 

But we only have a few things to do with code and we do it again and again:
- assigning a variable
- calculating something
- evaluating a condition
- ...

We also spend of time iterating over collections of data. What if we could just update every element of the collection in a single computation unit of time without any iteration ? In that case we need to accept that time and space are just beautiful abstractions, not reality.

But hey, I'm just a programmer, not a physicist.
